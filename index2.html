<p> I am currently learning to <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/"> code with Code First Girls. </a> Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>

<ol>
<li>HTML is cool
<li>CSS is cooler
<li>JS is the best</li>
</ol>

What do you need to create a website?

<ul>
<li>Not much!
<li>A computer (always a good start)
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ul>
